        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I graduated from Western State Colorado University with a B.S. in geology. Alhtough I have a passion for geology after working in the career field for a year I decided it was not for me. I moved to Utah in 2020 to take time enjoying the outdoors to decide what to do next. During this I met many feloow skiiers and rock climbers that worked in web development and loved it! After looking into it I realized that the problem solving and logic involved reminded me of geology and I was hooked! 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p> I have been studying HTML, CSS, and recently javascript through the coding bootcamp at the University of Utah. I am trying to use my previous geology problem solving skills to jump into coding!</p>
